# Brasov - Project for Stream 1 - Code Institute

This is a basic presentation website for my home city Brasov, Romania.

- It has been created in PyCharm using HTML5, CSS3.
- Bootstrap has been used for responsiveness 
- jQuery and ScrollSpy was used to animate the page.
- Extra fonts have been added from Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
- Used Google Maps API to show where the city is located inside Romania.
- Used YouTube iframes to embed a video and used CSS to style it and make it responsive



The website has a flat, clean and responsive interface. User interface is easy to understand and straight forward.
The navigation menu is fixed on the top of the page. All information is divided in separate Sections. 
To navigate around the page you need to click/tap on the links. 
ScrollSpy animates the website and makes it "scroll-down" to the section you clicked/tapped on.

"Home" section has a Bootstrap Carousel that shows pictures with the main Landmarks in the city centre.

"History" section tells us when the city was founded and its importance in the Medieval Ages. Below there is 3 pictures showing important buildings during that time. When hovering the mouse over/tapping on the picture there is some extra information sliding down.

"Tourism" section shows other attractions around the city - Dracula's Castle being the most famous and it's located at about 30 minutes drive from the city center. Then there is a video that shows Brasov and its sorroundings - all being filmed with a drone.

"Events" section has information about the Concerts/Festivals/Gigs happening in the coming months and under each event there is a button that links to a ticket website.

"Contact" section has a form that can be used to send an email to the website admins and the contact address. Also Google API is used to show where the city is located inside Romania.

The footer has social media links and a link to the author's personal website.
